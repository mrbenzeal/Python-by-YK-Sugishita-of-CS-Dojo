# What are Dictionaries in Python?
# This is sort of like a look-up table
# It can sometimes be referred to as key-value pairs, e.g, in a predefined dictionary: d = {"George": 24, "Tom": 32};
# where the key is some unique identifier, while the value is something we associate with that key.

# To create an empty dictionary, we can write: d = dict() or as below 

d = {}

# The above defines an empty dictionary.
